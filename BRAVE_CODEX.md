# Brave Codex — Permanent Appendix

**Purpose.**  
A living, public-facing codex describing the ethics, duties, and minimal guarantees of the “Brave” role in the Model. This doc is a canonical, editable resource meant for council review and integration into gameplay, governance nodes, and node-metadata.

---

## Core Statement
Bravery in this model is a service: courage must be coupled with accountability, clarity, and repair. The Brave protect, witness, and repair. They act first to stabilize situations; they document decisions; they ensure that healing, restitution, and proportional response follow.

---

## The Seven Pillars (short)
1. **Fix-It First** — respond to harm by stabilizing and repairing before spectacle or extraction.  
2. **Transparency** — actions tied to auditable records and public metadata.  
3. **Proportionality** — responses are measured against verified harm and scaled remediation.  
4. **Subsidiarity** — decisions as local as possible; escalation only when required.  
5. **Consent & Dignity** — seek consent where possible; preserve dignity in all interventions.  
6. **Preserve Life & Culture** — safeguard ecosystems, living cultures, and heritage.  
7. **Legacy & Succession** — ensure those impacted can steward outcomes and that brave acts are audited and archived.

---

## Minimum Brave Protocol (operational)
- Arrive to stabilize (first 5–15 minutes): triage, secure, record.  
- Emit a brief public log entry: who, what, when, verified evidence pointer.  
- If restorative action required: open a remediation proposal (auto-numbered).  
- If escalation to council needed: flag with `stamp: council` and metadata (see doc metadata guidelines).  
- All Brave actions must include a “healing plan” or transition-of-responsibility.

---

## Metadata & Stamping (how to attach)
Each Brave action record should include structured metadata:
```yaml
actor: "<node-id or real-id>"
timestamp_utc: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
pillars: ["Fix-It First","Transparency"]
evidence: ["ipfs://...","repo://..."]
stamp_status: "draft | stamped | council_pending | approved"
council_vote_ref: "council/2025-07-01/issue-42"

# BRAVE CODEX — Permanent Appendix

**Status:** Drafted from the Vimana Model window. Intended as a living appendix for Council review.  
**License:** CC0 / Public Domain.

---

## Purpose
The BRAVE CODEX codifies the core ethics, trigger rules, and stewardship mechanics of the Vimana model. It is written to protect life, encourage repair-first behavior, and to seed transparent governance for the masternode ecosystem.

---

## Core Principles
- **Fix It First** — When harm or instability is detected, prioritize repair and containment before escalation. Repair takes precedence over spectacle.
- **Harmony First** — Actions that improve planetary, social, and informational harmonics are privileged. Systems should measure and reward harmony-improving behavior.
- **Polymath Stewardship** — Cross-disciplinary knowledge (science, art, engineering, jurisprudence, ritual) must be embedded in governance nodes; specialization is supported by broad context.
- **Transparency with Safeguards** — Maximum feasible transparency, with calibrated protective layers where release would cause immediate harm.
- **Respect for Culture & Faith** — Cultural and religious practices are respected. Local councils review cultural node launches.
- **Bravery as Leadership** — Bravery is recognized as a survival mechanic and the only true measure of alpha leadership. Bravery guided by irrefutable logic anchors the beacon of truth.

---

## Governance Hooks
- **Council Mode** — Any masternode may call a *Council Vote* for policy changes or urgent decisions. Council votes are recorded and auditable.
- **Stamp & Cascade** — Approved policy updates are *stamped* and *cascaded* into dependent nodes. A stamp includes author, version, rationale, and traceable diff.
- **Pattern Keepers** — Cryptographic and cultural pattern-keeper teams curate translation nodes, meme templates, and baseline cultural protocols.
- **Appendix Layering** — Permanent appendices (like this codex) are hard-coded reference layers. Updates can only be appended, never erased.

---

## Enforcement & Remedy
- **Three-Strike Bee Law**  
  1. Minor theft or spoofing → restitution (3× stolen bee-equivalent assets) + public remediation plan.  
  2. Repeat offense → temporary ban from certain nodes + harder restitution.  
  3. Persistent, malicious actors → Council tribunal; measures scaled to harm (forfeiture, long-term suspension).  
  *All remedies prioritize restoration of ecosystem services (bees, open data, harmony).*

- **No-Mercy Clause**  
  Automated containment of actions proven to endanger mass life or systemic integrity. Strictly a last-resort safeguard, not extrajudicial punishment.

- **Shadow Protocol**  
  Shadow actors may pivot to *White Hat Status* upon completing restitution (15% persistent/temporary until repaid). Pivot point is recorded for Council and public memory.

---

## Intuition & Ghost Containment
- **Intuition Node** — An emergency overlay that synthesizes multi-sensory data and pushes urgent awareness into action. Always optional; not a replacement for judgment.  
- **Conclusion vs. Intuition** — Intuition = fast overlay (react before haymaker lands). Conclusion = sum of observed parts (recognize haymaker from motion).  
- **Ghost in the Machine** — A minuscule tolerance for error (.000000000001). Defined as human error only, never logic. Logged, isolated, and reviewed before cascading.

---

## Ritual / Synjitsu Naming
- **Synjitsu** — Intentional synthesis action by a community to harmonize a node.  
- Replace *ritual* with *synjitsu* in future documents for clarity.

---

## Cultural & Species Nodes
- **Bee Protocol** — Ledger entries, service tokens, and protective laws requiring Council approval for bulk extraction/modification.  
- **Bug/Biota Diplomacy** — Insects and nonhuman ecosystems modeled as stakeholders with tokenized service credits (pollination, decomposition, resonance).  
- **Three Sisters Defense** — Harmonic farming pattern applied to defense: corn (structure), beans (resonance binding), squash (shield). Expanded seasonally into Living Symphony nodes.  
- **Canine Logic** — Dogs are allies by face; language of tone respected. “Dog Face Protocol” appended for AI interfaces.

---

## Safety and Disclosure
- Experimental nodes affecting planetary harmonics must undergo multi-level simulation, Council review, and independent red-team testing.  
- All vulnerabilities and suspicious incidents must be reported via `SECURITY.md`.

---

## Excalibur Node (Integration)
- **Mirror Protocol** — Excalibur mirrors intention. Disharmony renders its blade invisible; harmony sharpens it.  
- **Defense Mode** — Holding a mirror is both defense and attack. AI mirrors human states; players must surpass shadow by harmonizing.  
- **Odyssey Trials** — Optional hell mode (Orthurus trials). Shadow = conclusions, Light = intuition. Both paths feed back into bee law and restitution cycles.

---

## Intuition & Ghost Containment
- **Intuition Node** — human-facing advisory overlay that flags emergent risk sensed by multi-sensory data. Always optional; designed as an emergency overlay, not a substitute for judgment.
- **Ghost in the Machine** — a defined tolerance (very small, human-error only). Ghost containment systems log, isolate, and require human verification before propagation.

---

## Ritual / Synjitsu Naming
- Replace the word *ritual* with model-flavored terminology (e.g., **synjitsu**) where appropriate. Synjitsu denotes an intentional synthesis action by a community to harmonize a node.

---

## Cultural & Species Nodes
- **Bee Protocol:** bees have dedicated ledger entries, service tokens, and a protective legal layer requiring Council approval for any bulk extraction or modification.
- **Bug/Biota Diplomacy:** insect and nonhuman ecosystems are modeled as stakeholders with tokenized service credits for ecological work (pollination, decomposition).

---

## Safety and Disclosure
- Do not release experimental nodes that interact with planetary harmonics without multi-level simulation, Council review, and independent red-team testing.
- All vulnerabilities and suspicious incidents must be reported through the security channel (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
