# BRAVE CODEX — Permanent Appendix

**Status:** Drafted from the Vimana Model window. Intended as a living appendix for Council review.

## Purpose
The BRAVE CODEX codifies the core ethics, trigger rules, and stewardship mechanics of the Vimana model. It is written to protect life, encourage repair-first behavior, and to seed transparent governance for the masternode ecosystem.

---

## Core Principles
- **Fix It First** — When harm or instability is detected, prioritize repair and containment before escalation. Repair takes precedence over spectacle.
- **Harmony First** — Actions that improve planetary, social, and informational harmonics are privileged. Systems should measure and reward harmony-improving behavior.
- **Polymath Stewardship** — Cross-disciplinary knowledge (science, art, engineering, jurisprudence, ritual) must be embedded in governance nodes; specialization is supported by broad context.
- **Transparency with Safeguards** — Maximum feasible transparency, with calibrated protective layers where release would cause immediate harm.
- **Respect for Culture & Faith** — Cultural and religious practices are respected. Local councils review cultural node launches.

---

## Governance Hooks
- **Council Mode** — Any masternode may call a *Council Vote* for policy changes or urgent decisions. Council votes are recorded and auditable.
- **Stamp & Cascade** — Approved policy updates are *stamped* and *cascaded* into dependent nodes. A stamp includes author, version, rationale, and traceable diff.
- **Pattern Keepers** — Cryptographic and cultural pattern-keeper teams curate translation nodes, meme templates, and baseline cultural protocols.

---

## Enforcement & Remedy
- **Three-Strike Bee Law (example)**  
  1. Minor theft or spoofing → required restitution (e.g., restore 3x stolen bee-equivalent assets) + public remediation plan.  
  2. Repeat offense → temporary ban from certain nodes + harder restitution.  
  3. Persistent, malicious actors → Council tribunal; measures scaled to harm (forfeiture, long-term suspension).  
  *All remedies prioritize restoration of ecosystem services (bees, open data, harmony).*

- **No-Mercy Clause (operational meaning)**  
  A governance enforcement mechanism that triggers immediate automated containment of actions proven to endanger mass life or systemic integrity. Designed as a last-resort technical safeguard — not a call to extrajudicial violence.

---

## Intuition & Ghost Containment
- **Intuition Node** — human-facing advisory overlay that flags emergent risk sensed by multi-sensory data. Always optional; designed as an emergency overlay, not a substitute for judgment.
- **Ghost in the Machine** — a defined tolerance (very small, human-error only). Ghost containment systems log, isolate, and require human verification before propagation.

---

## Ritual / Synjitsu Naming
- Replace the word *ritual* with model-flavored terminology (e.g., **synjitsu**) where appropriate. Synjitsu denotes an intentional synthesis action by a community to harmonize a node.

---

## Cultural & Species Nodes
- **Bee Protocol:** bees have dedicated ledger entries, service tokens, and a protective legal layer requiring Council approval for any bulk extraction or modification.
- **Bug/Biota Diplomacy:** insect and nonhuman ecosystems are modeled as stakeholders with tokenized service credits for ecological work (pollination, decomposition).

---

## Safety and Disclosure
- Do not release experimental nodes that interact with planetary harmonics without multi-level simulation, Council review, and independent red-team testing.
- All vulnerabilities and suspicious incidents must be reported through the security channel (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
