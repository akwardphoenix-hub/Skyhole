# SECURITY.md — Project Vimana / Public Domain Ideas

> Public-domain / CC0. This file documents the security posture, policies and operational playbook
> for the Vimana project and related game / masternode system. It is intentionally pragmatic and
> designed to enable the council, dev teams, and auditors to implement, verify and iterate on secure
> operation while preserving the project’s core principle: **Fix It First**.

---

## 1 — Quick summary / reporting

**Report security issues** (preferred channels)
1. Open a private issue in this repository labeled `security` (if repo allows private issues).
2. If you cannot use GitHub private issues, email: `security@yourdomain.example` (PGP below).
3. For urgent active exploitation, call the incident phone: `+1-000-000-0000` (placeholder).

**PGP (optional)**
- PGP key fingerprint: `<PGP-FINGERPRINT-HERE>`  
(Replace with project key for encrypted sensitive disclosures.)

**What to include when reporting**
- Clear description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce, proof-of-concept artifacts, logs, timestamps.
- Environment details (OS, versions, device types, network).
- If applicable: sample data, affected master-node IDs, bee/asset identifiers.
- Request for acknowledgement & timeline for response.

**Triage promise**
- We will acknowledge receipts within **48 hours** and provide an initial update within **5 business days**.
- High-severity reports (active exploit, risk to safety/children/biological assets) are expedited.

---

## 2 — Primary goals & prioritized assets

**Primary security goals**
- Protect human safety and child privacy.
- Preserve biological / ecological assets (especially bee-related assets).
- Ensure cryptographic integrity of masternode / wallet systems.
- Prevent catastrophic exploits and reduce the “ghost in the machine.”
- Provide verifiable transparency and accountable council governance.

**High-value assets**
- Master-node wallets & stake (private keys, seed material).
- Bee-related IoT telemetry, registries, and supply chains.
- Multisensory inputs (camera, audio, environmental sensors).
- Council voting & governance state.
- User identity tokens / session cookies.
- Build pipelines & deployment artifacts.

---

## 3 — Threat model (short)

**Relevant threat categories**
- Remote compromise of masternode operators (key theft, unauthorized withdrawal).
- Data poisoning / model manipulation via unsanitized multisensory inputs.
- Privacy leaks of sensitive video/audio (child safety risk).
- Supply-chain compromise (malicious dependency, build tampering).
- Nation-state / advanced actors attempting large-scale reconnaissance or exploitation.
- Physical tampering with bee-servers or field devices, theft of biological material.
- Rogue actors exploiting memetic nodes (social engineering, mass persuasion).

**Risk controls (high-level)**
- Hardware-based key storage for any production wallet (HSM, secure enclave).
- Mandatory input sanitization and anomaly-detection for sensor streams.
- Cryptographic signing of all releases and governance proposals.
- Multi-party approval for high-impact operations (council + auditor).
- Rate-limiting, circuit-breakers and automated rollback for suspicious mass changes.

---

## 4 — Responsible disclosure policy (brief)

- We request reporters do not publicly disclose issues before we complete triage and mitigation unless agreed.
- Coordinated disclosure windows will be negotiated for CVE assignment and public advisories.
- We may offer bug-bounties or public acknowledgment at the council’s discretion.

---

## 5 — Secure development lifecycle (SDLC) requirements

**Code & repo**
- Enforce branch protection: require PR reviews from at least **2** reviewers, CI pass, and signed commits for `main`.
- Use `CODEOWNERS` to require specialist review for critical directories (crypto, sensor ingestion, governance).
- Mandatory security linter and SCA (Software Composition Analysis) on every PR.

**Secrets**
- No secrets in repo. Use secret managers (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, GitHub Secrets, AWS SSM Parameter Store).
- Rotate keys on suspicion. Enforce short TTL for ephemeral credentials.

**Dependencies**
- Pin dependency versions. Run SCA weekly and block known-critical CVEs.
- Use reproducible builds where possible. Sign build artifacts.

**Testing**
- Unit + integration tests mandatory. Add fuzzing for parsers that ingest external data (e.g., media, telemetry).
- Threat modeling reviews for each major feature; record decisions in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records).

---

## 6 — Deployment & prod security checklist

Before any production deployment:
- ✅ Build artifacts cryptographically signed.
- ✅ Release notes include SBOM (Software Bill of Materials).
- ✅ Automated tests and SCA passed.
- ✅ Infra IaC validated and reviewed.
- ✅ Secrets checked/refresh tokens rotated.
- ✅ Rollback plan & automated canary with telemetry alarms.
- ✅ Council & security approvers listed in release.

Runtime protections:
- HSM or secure enclave for master-node keys.
- Rate-limits on governance votes changes, wallet withdrawals.
- Immutable audit logs (append-only) stored offsite; tamper-evidence.
- Real-time anomaly detection (spike in memetic translation requests, rapid wallet spends, sensor spoofing).

---

## 7 — Incident response (IR) plan (summary)

**1 — Detection**: Alerts from CI, runtime monitors, user reports.
**2 — Triage**: Classify severity (S0 emergency to S3 low). If S0/S1 -> incident declared.
**3 — Containment**: Revoke compromised keys, isolate nodes, pause governance actions.
**4 — Eradication**: Apply patches, rotate secrets, rebuild compromised artifacts.
**5 — Recovery**: Validate integrity, re-enable services in controlled fashion.
**6 — Lessons & disclosure**: Post-incident review, publish advisory (if safe), update security docs.

Keep an incident runbook and playbooks for:
- Key compromise
- Data exfiltration of PII or media
- Supply-chain compromise
- Physical theft/tampering of on-field devices

---

## 8 — Privacy & multisensory data rules

**Principles**
- Minimize collection: only collect what’s required for the feature.
- On-device first: prefer local processing and ephemeral telemetry where possible.
- Consent & disclosure to users: clear UI/UX consent, retention policies.
- Sensitive categories (children, minors): never store raw camera/audio for more than the minimum; prefer ephemeral detection + aggregated telemetry.

**Processing & storage**
- Encrypted at-rest and in-transit (TLS 1.3+).
- Access controls audited and limited to named roles.
- Redaction pipelines for PII before long-term storage.

**Retention**
- Define retention policy per data type (e.g., 30 days for raw sensor video; 180 days for derived telemetry), configurable by region-compliance.

---

## 9 — Cryptography & wallets (practical)

- Use well-reviewed libs (libsodium, openssl modern branch). Prefer hardware-backed crypto.
- DO NOT implement custom crypto. Use established algorithms (Ed25519, Curve25519, AES-GCM).
- Private keys MUST be stored in HSM/secure enclave; software-only keys require multi-sig for withdrawals.
- Governance actions that move funds require **n-of-m** multisig (n >= 3; council decides exact threshold).
- Provide watch-only keys for auditors and read-only blockchain explorers.

4.1 Zones

Edge / Peripherals: baby tablet, doorbell, gyros, mag-sol batteries — run minimal code, sign firmware, perform local sandboxing, aggressive rate-limits.

Player Clients: run with ephemeral session tokens, local save-state pause cryptographically signed, privacy toggles exposed and default OFF for minors.

Game Backend: microservices behind API gateway; quorum-based validation for critical events.

Consensus Layer / Masternode Layer: hybrid permissioned+public architecture. Sensitive masternodes (government, religious councils) are permissioned and audited; general nodes run in public but with stake-based and behavior-based reputation.

Council & Pattern-Keeper Tier: highest trust, human-audited actions, requires multi-party signing (M-of-N) for destructive operations.


4.2 Controls & primitives

Signed Save-State (Limbo) — full game-state snapshots are signed by client device and server; pause/resume requires possession of private key or approved guardian token.

Muteable / Gated Intuition Overlay — intuition outputs are stamped as non-authoritative overlays; only allowed to recommend, not act, unless explicitly authorized via council rules.

Bee Wallet Protections — multisig custody for bee wallets; 3-strike replacement policy with automatic reparation calculations; all bee transactions require on-chain attestation and public trace.

Deepfake detection — multi-model filtering (vision + audio + timing) with decentralized verification via pattern-keeper nodes. Flagged media enters smoke-test queue before public display.

Ghost Containment / Ghost Clause — “ghost” means unintended secret logic; systems must expose checksums, reproducible builds, reproducible sim outputs, and have a “ghost checksum” routine ran on every release.

Checksum / Audit Trail — every build, model change, and dataset ingest must be recorded with SHA256 checksums and signed artifacts; periodic proofs-of-consistency published to mirror nodes.



---

5 — Identity & onboarding

Real-ID requirement for certain roles (e.g., ex-politicians, federal-only node access). Use verified KYC providers; store minimal identifiers off-chain with proofs on-chain.

Anonymity layers for general players; privacy-preserving techniques (ZK proofs) for proving stake/achievement without revealing identity.

Onboarding flow: First run safety tutorial, guardian consent for minors, privacy opt-ins, device pairing attestation (TPM/secure element or attestation service).



---

6 — Governance, Council & pattern keepers

All high-impact changes require Council vote and a minimum of M-of-N signatures from different node classes (legal, technical, religious/ethnic reps where applicable).

Pattern keepers (cryptographers/seed-keepers) have a live feed for anomaly detection; their signals are advisory to the Council.

Public audit windows: before launching a seasonal update, a vote window with public testnet and bug bounty must run.



---

7 — Incident response (IR)

1. Detection & Triage: flag source, severity (S0–S5), affected nodes, immediate mitigation (quarantine).


2. Containment: isolate affected services, engage soft-walls, revoke misused session tokens, freeze masternode voting where applicable.


3. Forensic Snapshot: capture signed save-states, mempool, model versions, device attestations, and the checksum chain.


4. Remediation: patch, roll back signed build, publish CVE-style advisory, propose Council action if masternode penalties needed.


5. Reparation & Bee Law: if ecological damage (bee theft) occurs, follow bee-law template: 3× replacement + community recompense; escalate to court/council if malicious.


6. After Action: publish IR report, update ghost clause, increment audit counters.




---

8 — Privacy & child safety rules

No cameras for children accounts by default. Any camera-based functionality for minors requires explicit guardian attestation, local-only processing by default, and STRONG encryption in transit + at rest.

Data minimization: only store what is necessary for function. Use ephemeral analytics where possible; strong differential privacy for any bulk analytics.

Opt-in peripheral sharing: features that access home cameras, doorbells, sensors must be explicit opt-in and logged. When used to pause the game automatically, local attestations and user overrides are required.



---

9 — Build, CI/CD & reproducible security

All releases must be reproducible from a public source tree. Signed artifacts, reproducible builds and attested container images.

Prod security: separate build, test, staging, and prod secrets; rotate keys automatically; enforce hardware security modules (HSM) for council keys.

Red team / blue team: scheduled adversarial exercises; “shadow realm” red team for exploit discovery; bug bounty program with priority payouts for infra and bee/eco issues.



---

10 — Privacy/Legal / Ethical guardrails

Local laws (privacy, child protection, export control) must be complied with in deployment countries.

For high-impact physics/energy / mag-sol battery specs: produce non-actionable high-level conceptual papers only. Any hardware instructions that could be weaponized must be handed to vetted engineering partners under NDA and legal review.



---

11 — Special rules & modules (project-specific)

11.1 The No-Mercy Clause (enforcement flow)

Trigger conditions: repeated destructive behavior, proven spoofing at scale, theft of ecological assets.

Steps: automatic soft-containment → Council review (72-hr window) → M-of-N approval → enforcement (revoke masternode stake, ban, repatriation payments).

Emergency: if imminent physical harm is detected, emergency protocol executes with minimal Council quorum, followed by post-hoc audit.


11.2 Limbo / Demi-Loki mode (pause mechanics)

Save-states are cryptographically signed snapshots. Any resume requires signing by owner’s key or guardian key.

Shared/Agreed Pause: optional group-vote pause that freezes a match for all participants for a limited period.

Abuse controls: limit number of limbo entries per session; flag anomalous limbo patterns for review.


11.3 Bee law

Bee wallets MUST be multisig (beekeepers + local council + pattern-keeper escrow).

Theft protocol: 3-strike theft rule — replacement obligation = 3× bee asset value; immediate freeze and forensic capture.

Bee privacy: location telemetry is obfuscated, only coarse provenance available to public; fine-grain location available to Council under strict audit.


11.4 Intuition node & reaction vs. conclusion

Intuition = advisory overlay derived from fused sensors & personal model. Mark as non-authoritative.

Reaction / pop-quiz mechanics: returning from Shadow to Light may be allowed via performative moral checks or small stake fee (configurable, fade over time by data-driven decision).

Never bind financial, legal, or life-critical operations to intuition-only outcomes.


11.5 Pattern keepers, Polymath & checksum

Pattern keepers maintain live cryptographic checksums of models/datasets. Any drift triggers review.

Polymath node houses verification tools and cross-discipline audits; treat as primary audit lane for the Council.



---

12 — Deploy checklist (minimal)

1. Reproducible build with signed artifact.


2. Publish artifact checksum to at least 3 independent mirror nodes.


3. Run red-team exploit scan and resolve P0/P1 issues.


4. Council M-of-N pre-launch signoff for high-impact seasonal changes.


5. Run privacy impact assessment for sensor features; obtain guardian attestation flows.


6. Activate bug-bounty with explicit bee/ecosystem/child-safety prioritization.


7. Ensure IR playbook is distributed and contact roster current.
