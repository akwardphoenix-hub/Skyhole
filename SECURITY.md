# Security.md

## Purpose
This repo operates as a **living codex**. Security here is not just technical, but harmonic, memetic, and ethical.

## Core Stable Protocols
- **Brave Codex** — Defines survival, leadership, and collective ethics.  
- **Bee Law (Three-Strike Rule)** — Protects balance, reciprocity, and ecological justice.  
- **Shadow Protocols** — Transparency filters, ghost containment, and error handling.  
- **Intuition Node** — Hard-coded survival overlay, not noise.  

## Experimental Protocols
These are optional, opt-in layers for testing and iteration:
- **Shadow Realm Trials** — Hard-mode layers (Odyssey / Orthrus, $0.50 toll system).  
- **Meme Logic University** — Humor as weaponized defense, timing as calibration.  
- **Excalibur Node** — Mirror-sword harmonics for defense/attack modeling.  

## Contribution Guidelines
- **Pattern Keepers**: Validate patterns, break where necessary, patch with integrity.  
- **White Hats**: Pivot from shadow work into constructive defense.  
- **Builders**: Focus on clean, modular implementations (no cruft, no vanity).  
- **Everyone**: Honor the Codex, keep transparency, respect humor as part of resilience.  

## Notes
This file is **not a lock** but a **mirror.** Its role is to show clearly what is stable, what is experimental, and where feedback loops exist.
