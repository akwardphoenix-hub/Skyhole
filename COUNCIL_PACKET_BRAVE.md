# Council Packet — BRAVE Codex (Executive Summary + Action Items)

Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Prepared by: Automated Audit Oracles / Drafting Team

---

## 1 — Executive Summary (one paragraph)
The Brave Codex formalizes a set of principles and mechanics to enable accountable, rapid, and auditable interventions ("Brave Actions") inside the model. It balances emergency responsiveness with transparency, auditability, and council oversight. The codex includes the No-Mercy Clause as an emergency failsafe (strict constraints), the Intuition Node design for surfacing emergency signals, and Bee/Land stewardship examples.

---

## 2 — Why adopt?
- Enables fast, legally-safe emergency responses.
- Provides explicit rollback and audit pathways to avoid abuse.
- Connects civic/ecosystem protections (bee law) with game mechanics.
- Makes the model governable and council-ready.

---

## 3 — Key Decisions Required
1. **Emergency threshold `R_brave`** — set default value (technical proposal attached).  
2. **Emergency signer count** — set multisigner requirement (suggest: 3 independent stewards).  
3. **Rollback window** (seconds) — default conservative (e.g., 600s).  
4. **Public vs private logging policy** — define which BraveAction fields are public.  
5. **Compensation fund rules** for accidental collateral harm.  
6. **Localization & cultural council review** before public rollout.

---

## 4 — Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Abuse of No-Mercy.  
  **Mitigation**: multisigner + immediate audit + automatic crim/eth review pipeline.
- **Risk**: Privacy leakage in public logs.  
  **Mitigation**: encrypted payloads + ZK proofs for verification.
- **Risk**: False positives in Intuition Node.  
  **Mitigation**: opt-in UX, low-sensitivity defaults, human confirmation.

---

## 5 — Implementation Plan (milestones)
- M0: Council approvals on thresholds & privacy (2 weeks)
- M1: Backend event schema + ledger hooks (3 weeks)
- M2: BraveAction UX prototypes + intuition overlay (2 weeks)
- M3: Red-team + blue-team simulations (4 weeks)
- M4: Public pilot (geographic/scale limited) + monitoring (6 weeks)
- M5: Global cascade + stamp (post-pilot, council vote)
