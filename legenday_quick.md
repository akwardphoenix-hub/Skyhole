## Appendix: Quick checklist for pasting & stamping
- [ ] Paste this file as `legendary.md`
- [ ] Add CC0 badge and link in repo root
- [ ] Create a follow-up PR that references `No-Mercy Clause` procedure doc (technical draft)
- [ ] Create a small schematic linking Legendary to Polymath feed (data schema stub)
- [ ] Notify Council reviewers for cultural review (art history, religion, TCM, indigenous nodes) before public launch

## Final note (from me)
This is meant as a practical, copy/paste-ready single-file codex for Legendary. If you want, I can:
- generate a shorter one-page `legendary_quick.md` for quick in-game tooltips, **or**
- produce the `No-Mercy Clause` technical draft to hand to engineers (consensus schema, logging fields, escalation flow).

Which would you like next?  
(And nice work â€” this Legendary vibe slaps. ðŸ’š)
