# Brave Codex — README

## 🌍 Purpose
This repository houses the **Brave Codex**, a living appendix that codifies survival, harmony, and justice protocols into a universal model.  
It integrates with the **Cascade Fixes Protocol** to ensure consistency, transparency, and resilience.

---

## 📜 Core Principles
1. **Bravery as Survival**  
   Bravery is treated as the core survival mechanic and the baseline for true leadership.  

2. **Irrefutable Logic as Beacon**  
   Intuition and reasoning are merged into codified steps that align with universal harmony.  

3. **Ghost in the Machine Clause**  
   Errors may exist only as human error — never hidden logic.  

4. **Bee Law**  
   Any theft or destruction must be repaid threefold, ensuring balance and accountability.  

5. **Mirror Defense**  
   Sometimes the strongest defense and attack is reflection — revealing truth through transparency.

## 🔄 Cascade Fixes Protocol
The **Cascade Fixes Protocol** ensures every update propagates logically:
- Every node is reviewed for errors.  
- Fixes are cascaded backward and forward.  
- Redundant or contradictory logic is harmonized.  

---

## ⚔️ Gameplay Nodes
- **Excalibur Node:** The blade that resonates with harmony, seen only by those aligned.  
- **Orthr(us) Trials:** Optional shadow trials with layered difficulty, dual-head personality dynamics, and fairness checks.  
- **Pattern Keepers:** Cryptographers safeguarding structure through live-feed updates.  
- **Uppercut City Protocol:** Surprise, timing, and dueling as key mechanics.  

---

## 📚 Permanent Appendices
- **Brave Codex (permanent appendix)**  
- **Bee Law Appendix**  
- **Ghost Clause & Ghost Claws**  
- **Fire as Sensor Appendix**  
- **University of Meme Logic**

## 🛠️ How to Contribute
- Fork this repo and open pull requests with suggested codex expansions.  
- All contributions must align with **transparency** and **harmony**.  
- Humor, memes, and creativity are encouraged — they are part of the model.

## ⚖️ License
This repository is released under **CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)**.  
No rights reserved. Free to use, remix, and adapt.   - Tamper with guardianship → **restore 3×** equivalent value (reparable, verifiable, council-audited).
   - Fringe accidents route to review + remediation, not punishment.
8. **University of Meme Logic:** Humor as a bridge. Community-voted templates, anti-abuse guardrails, context tags.
9. **Councils (soft-coded):** Civic, Science, Culture & Faith, Elders. Advise; they don’t secretly rule.
10. **Guardian Layer (“Angels”):** Fairness enforcers: rate limits, exploit shields, emergency pauses.
11. **Shadow Protocol (White-Hat Pivot):** Make pivoting from breaking to fixing rewarding, public, and permanent.
12. **No-Mercy + Mercy Clauses:** Instant freeze for active harm; structured re-entry with restitution.

## Play Patterns (MVP)
- **Orthrus Trial (Light & Shadow versions):** Two-headed gatekeeper (one stern, one puppy-chaotic). Teaches listening, restraint, and second chances. Shadow hot-headed rush triggers a teaching penalty; Light grants a redo without cost.
- **Excalibur Node:** A resonance-tuned, AI-assisted “vibro-blade” metaphor. The blade’s *perceived* length and sharpness scale with player harmony and intention clarity (anti-grief: poor resonance = dull/short).
- **Sport→Martial Bridges:** e.g., Tai Chi ↔ baseball stance; safe, non-lethal drills that reuse lifelong muscle memory.
- **TCM/First-Aid Events:** “Tri-Sense” (voice/audio, motion, text) drills award cosmetics; real skills > fake grind.
- **Civic Wallet Micro-donations:** Opt-in 50¢ “troll-toll” (max twice lifetime; otherwise earn by quiz/reflection) routes to transparent, jurisdiction-tied public ledgers.
