# Brave Codex ‚Äî README

## üåç Purpose
This repository houses the **Brave Codex**, a living appendix that codifies survival, harmony, and justice protocols into a universal model.  
It integrates with the **Cascade Fixes Protocol** to ensure consistency, transparency, and resilience.

---

## üìú Core Principles
1. **Bravery as Survival**  
   Bravery is treated as the core survival mechanic and the baseline for true leadership.  

2. **Irrefutable Logic as Beacon**  
   Intuition and reasoning are merged into codified steps that align with universal harmony.  

3. **Ghost in the Machine Clause**  
   Errors may exist only as human error ‚Äî never hidden logic.  

4. **Bee Law**  
   Any theft or destruction must be repaid threefold, ensuring balance and accountability.  

5. **Mirror Defense**  
   Sometimes the strongest defense and attack is reflection ‚Äî revealing truth through transparency.

---

## üîÑ Cascade Fixes Protocol
The **Cascade Fixes Protocol** ensures every update propagates logically:
- Every node is reviewed for errors.  
- Fixes are cascaded backward and forward.  
- Redundant or contradictory logic is harmonized.  

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Gameplay Nodes
- **Excalibur Node:** The blade that resonates with harmony, seen only by those aligned.  
- **Orthr(us) Trials:** Optional shadow trials with layered difficulty, dual-head personality dynamics, and fairness checks.  
- **Pattern Keepers:** Cryptographers safeguarding structure through live-feed updates.  
- **Uppercut City Protocol:** Surprise, timing, and dueling as key mechanics.  

---

## üìö Permanent Appendices
- **Brave Codex (permanent appendix)**  
- **Bee Law Appendix**  
- **Ghost Clause & Ghost Claws**  
- **Fire as Sensor Appendix**  
- **University of Meme Logic**  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute
- Fork this repo and open pull requests with suggested codex expansions.  
- All contributions must align with **transparency** and **harmony**.  
- Humor, memes, and creativity are encouraged ‚Äî they are part of the model.

## ‚öñÔ∏è License
This repository is released under **CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)**.  
No rights reserved. Free to use, remix, and adapt.   - Tamper with guardianship ‚Üí **restore 3√ó** equivalent value (reparable, verifiable, council-audited).
   - Fringe accidents route to review + remediation, not punishment.
8. **University of Meme Logic:** Humor as a bridge. Community-voted templates, anti-abuse guardrails, context tags.
9. **Councils (soft-coded):** Civic, Science, Culture & Faith, Elders. Advise; they don‚Äôt secretly rule.
10. **Guardian Layer (‚ÄúAngels‚Äù):** Fairness enforcers: rate limits, exploit shields, emergency pauses.
11. **Shadow Protocol (White-Hat Pivot):** Make pivoting from breaking to fixing rewarding, public, and permanent.
12. **No-Mercy + Mercy Clauses:** Instant freeze for active harm; structured re-entry with restitution.

---

## Play Patterns (MVP)
- **Orthrus Trial (Light & Shadow versions):** Two-headed gatekeeper (one stern, one puppy-chaotic). Teaches listening, restraint, and second chances. Shadow hot-headed rush triggers a teaching penalty; Light grants a redo without cost.
- **Excalibur Node:** A resonance-tuned, AI-assisted ‚Äúvibro-blade‚Äù metaphor. The blade‚Äôs *perceived* length and sharpness scale with player harmony and intention clarity (anti-grief: poor resonance = dull/short).
- **Sport‚ÜíMartial Bridges:** e.g., Tai Chi ‚Üî baseball stance; safe, non-lethal drills that reuse lifelong muscle memory.
- **TCM/First-Aid Events:** ‚ÄúTri-Sense‚Äù (voice/audio, motion, text) drills award cosmetics; real skills > fake grind.
- **Civic Wallet Micro-donations:** Opt-in 50¬¢ ‚Äútroll-toll‚Äù (max twice lifetime; otherwise earn by quiz/reflection) routes to transparent, jurisdiction-tied public ledgers.

## ü¶Å The Brave Codex
The BRAVE CODEX is the living appendix for this model.  
üëâ [Read it here](BRAVE_CODEX.md)
# Project: Vimana ‚Äî Design Window & Transformation

This repository contains the full public-domain design for the "Vimana" model ‚Äî a game/system of nodes, nodes-council, social & cyber-security primitives, cultural nodes, and world-building artifacts.

**Important:** All content here is published under CC0 / Public Domain. Use, remix, and build freely.

Key docs:
- TRANSFORMATION.md ‚Äî how this raw chat window became the model (provenance + narrative).
- CHANGELOG.md ‚Äî timeline of major decisions + versions.
- APPENDICES/ ‚Äî finalized codices (bee law, Excalibur, intuition node, etc.).
- LICENSE ‚Äî CC0 declaration.

If you want the short story: this started as a public brainstorming window and matured into a structured, auditable design that preserves the author's voice and intent.

# VIMANA ‚Äî Public Domain Seed (CC0)
*An experimental, open-source, public-domain framework for an inclusion-first civic / game / masternode ecosystem.*

**License:** CC0 ‚Äî public domain (copy of DECLARATION included in /LICENSE)

## Summary
This repo contains the living design for "Vimana": a layered game + civic masternode model with the core principles:
- **Fix-it-first**: security & safety are built before cosmetic/gameplay layering.
- **Personal masternodes**: each citizen/player is their own RNG/security node.
- **Harmony & resonance**: time/astral anchors (North Star time, Sun/Moon/pyramids) integrated into UX.
- **Civic-economic tie-in**: transparent incentives for public goods; modular political engagement channels.
- **Open culture**: CC0 ‚Äî use, remix, steward.

## Contents
- /design ‚Äî core logic decks, gameplay loops, node glossary
- /codex ‚Äî permanent appendices (Bee Law, No-Mercy Clause, Shadow Protocol)
- /tech ‚Äî API draft (LNA), minimal mirror test, security adapters
- /art ‚Äî harmony posters and visual assets (public-domain)
- /legal ‚Äî sample handoff packet, CC0 license copy, recommended counsel contacts
- /appendix ‚Äî curated ideas: Orthrus trials, Demi-Loki mode, Tree-People mechanics

## Quick start for engineers
1. Review `/tech/LNA-minimal.md` for the minimal API and mirror test.
2. Deploy `testnet` node using the included docker-compose in `/tech/deploy/`.
3. Run the first mirror test (see `/tech/mirror-test.md`).

## Handoff & governance
- This repo is a living document. Any large changes that affect governance must be routed via the Council Packet procedure in `/codex/council-procedure.md`.

## Contact / steward notes
- The author has released this under CC0. Use and iterate ‚Äî please credit if useful, but no obligation.
