# SKYHOLE
*A fix-it-first civic MMO + harmonized OS (design spec, CC0)*

Skyhole is a public-domain blueprint for a cooperative game/OS that treats real-world problem solving as the core loop. It blends a playful MMO layer (events, trials, cosmetics) with a civic layer (micro-donations, open councils, transparent audits) and a safety layer (pause/limbo, white-hat pivot, consent-first sensing). Everything here is **CC0**—fork, remix, and ship.

> **Project status:** Early design. This repo is a living spec + starter tasks for engineers, researchers, policymakers, artists, and culture bearers.

## What Skyhole *is*
- A **fix-it-first** framework where games drive measurable good (first aid, resilience drills, local projects).
- A **civic rails** concept (micro-donations, verified deliberation, public metrics).
- A **safety-first runtime** (always-on pause, consented sensing, transparent moderation, red-team sandboxes).
- A **culture lab** (meme translation, interfaith accommodations, language bridges, seasonal festivals).

## What Skyhole *is not*
- Not finished software. This is a spec + contribution map.
- Not medical, legal, or emergency advice. It provides drills and hand-offs to real services.
- Not surveillance tech. All sensors are **opt-in**, local-first, and auditable.

## Core Principles
1. **Fix-It-First:** Fun never trumps safety. If tension arises, we pause, patch, resume.
2. **Consent, Transparency, Accountability:** No hidden collection; no dark patterns; auditable logs.
3. **Personal Masternode:** Each player has a self-owned identity/RNG profile used for trust and flavor—not for ads.
4. **Pause Everywhere:** 
   - **Solo Pause** (instant), **Party Pause** (vote), **AOE Pause** (mutual consent across sides).
   - **Demi-Loki (Limbo)**: suspended play state; no grind loss; anti-abuse rate limits.
5. **Intuition vs. Conclusion:**
   - **Intuition** = fast, embodied warnings (subtle UI hints).
   - **Conclusion** = reasoned, after-the-fact judgments (clear prompts).
6. **Light Realm / Shadow Realm:**
   - **Light:** learning-forward, generous failsafes.
   - **Shadow:** opt-in hard mode; White-Hat pivot always available; fair exits (quiz or micro-donation).
7. **Bee Law (Ecosystem Stewardship):**
   - Tamper with guardianship → **restore 3×** equivalent value (reparable, verifiable, council-audited).
   - Fringe accidents route to review + remediation, not punishment.
8. **University of Meme Logic:** Humor as a bridge. Community-voted templates, anti-abuse guardrails, context tags.
9. **Councils (soft-coded):** Civic, Science, Culture & Faith, Elders. Advise; they don’t secretly rule.
10. **Guardian Layer (“Angels”):** Fairness enforcers: rate limits, exploit shields, emergency pauses.
11. **Shadow Protocol (White-Hat Pivot):** Make pivoting from breaking to fixing rewarding, public, and permanent.
12. **No-Mercy + Mercy Clauses:** Instant freeze for active harm; structured re-entry with restitution.

## Play Patterns (MVP)
- **Orthrus Trial (Light & Shadow versions):** Two-headed gatekeeper (one stern, one puppy-chaotic). Teaches listening, restraint, and second chances. Shadow hot-headed rush triggers a teaching penalty; Light grants a redo without cost.
- **Excalibur Node:** A resonance-tuned, AI-assisted “vibro-blade” metaphor. The blade’s *perceived* length and sharpness scale with player harmony and intention clarity (anti-grief: poor resonance = dull/short).
- **Sport→Martial Bridges:** e.g., Tai Chi ↔ baseball stance; safe, non-lethal drills that reuse lifelong muscle memory.
- **TCM/First-Aid Events:** “Tri-Sense” (voice/audio, motion, text) drills award cosmetics; real skills > fake grind.
- **Civic Wallet Micro-donations:** Opt-in 50¢ “troll-toll” (max twice lifetime; otherwise earn by quiz/reflection) routes to transparent, jurisdiction-tied public ledgers.
