TRANSFORMATION: From Window to Model

1. Purpose

This document explains how the original design window — a raw, continuous creative conversation — was transformed into a structured project. It records intent, major decisions, and the living provenance of the ideas so future builders, reviewers, and citizens can understand the "why" behind each rule.

2. Short story of transformation

This project began as a freeform, sometimes profane, always honest conversation with a design partner. It captured dreams about games, civic systems, polymath nodes, bees, harmony, and protecting public goods. From that stream we distilled: core philosophy (Fix It First), core mechanics (nodes, councils, masternodes), and governance primitives (council votes, three-strike bee law, intuition node, no-mercy clause).

We intentionally preserved the author's voice as evidence of provenance and to keep the creative spark that generated this system. The project was organized to balance play, security, and civic utility.
