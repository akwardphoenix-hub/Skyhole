VIMANA — EXPERT HANDOFF PACKET (one-page)

Purpose: move project from creative design into expert implementation (security engineers, civics legal, gameplay engineers, TCM/energy advisors).

1) High-level goals
  - Build secure masternode backbone (personal node per citizen).
  - Implement fix-it-first, no-ghost-in-system rules.
  - Integrate Harmony time display: North Star time (sidereal-based) shown next to local time.

2) Immediate deliverables for first contract (MVP)
  - Minimal LNA API (authentication, wallet, node status).
  - Mirror test harness (one server/client pair).
  - Bee-law enforcement ruleset and 3-strike enforcement demo.
  - Pause/limbo save-state prototype (local/consensus pause options).

3) Security / governance requirements
  - Red-team/blue-team penetration plan (hard quarantine for grave exploits).
  - Council verification cross-node procedure.
  - “No Mercy” clause: rules to be encoded as smart-contract/DAO motions (draft included in /codex).

4) Legal / regulatory notes
  - CC0 licensing confirmed in /LICENSE.
  - Political engagement features recommended to be implemented with legal counsel for jurisdictional compliance.

5) Assets included
  - README, initial tech spec, LNA draft, mirror-test, codex appendix list, visual harmony posters.

6) Next action (for implementers)
  - Run mirror test, produce security report (72h sprint), then deliver demo to council.
