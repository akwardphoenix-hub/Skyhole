# Brave Codex — Appendix (PERMANENT)

> Purpose: provide a compact, implementable codex for the "Brave" archetype (values, mechanics, governance, and integration guidance) to be used as an appendix to the main model.  
> Status: Draft → Council Review → Stamped → Cascade into nodes.

## 0 — Overview
**Brave** is a stewardship archetype: people who act with courage, accountability, and practical compassion when systems or communities need repair. The Brave Codex defines responsibilities, incentives, and safeguards so "bravery" is productive, not destructive.

This codex is meant to be:
- **Transparent** — machine- and human-readable rules
- **Accountable** — audit trails, reversible actions
- **Practical** — minimal friction for real-world behavior
- **Cascade-able** — instructions for folding into game/nodes/council systems

---

## 1 — Core Principles
1. **Fix-It-First** — act to repair harm before claiming victory. Priority: safety → recovery → optimization.
2. **Love As Strategy** — empathy is tactical. The default posture is de-escalation unless force is necessary for protection.
3. **Courage With Limits** — bravery does not mean lawlessness. Bravery is constrained by agreed rules, audits, and proportionality.
4. **Transparency by Default** — actions that materially affect others must be recorded, visible to the appropriate oversight layer.
5. **Subsidiarity** — local communities decide first, escalating only when they cannot safely resolve an issue.

---

## 2 — Roles & Permissions
- **Brave Actor (Player role)** — can initiate emergency interventions, propose "brave actions," and trigger short-lived authoritative effects (see triggers).
- **Brave Steward (Council role)** — a voted representative that can approve persistent changes, create overrides, and review interventions.
- **Audit Oracles** — automated systems that log events, gather proofs (telemetry), and prepare packets for review.
- **Shadow / Light Observers** — read-only watchers who can flag behavior for investigation.

Permissions must be implemented with signed transactions + verifiable logs.

---

## 3 — Brave Actions (mechanics)
A Brave Action is a bounded intervention that:
- Has an explicit **intent** and **scope**.
- Must be announced publicly in the event ledger (or to the immediate affected parties).
- Automatically creates a rollback window and audit record.

**Types**
- **Pause & Preserve** — immediate full-state pause (limbo) for a single player/session to preserve real-life priorities (doorbell, kid, medical).
- **Heal & Redirect** — temporary resource reallocation to fix emergent harm (e.g., emergency aid).
- **Root & Remand** — mark corrupted node(s) for quarantine & referral to authorities.
- **Test & Simulate** — sandboxed stress-tests of a node’s defense (requires prior council sign-off).

**Constraints**
- Brave Actions must not exceed a risk threshold `R_brave` (configurable, default conservative).
- Emergency interventions > `R_brave` require immediate post-action council review and documentation.

---

## 4 — The No-Mercy Clause (operationalized)
The No-Mercy Clause is a narrowly-scoped enforcement tool:
- Purpose: to stop malicious actors rapidly where harm is imminent and de-escalation has failed.
- Activation: requires either (A) a multi-signer emergency approval (3 independent stewards) OR (B) an automated detection + temporary one-time override **only** if human life, major infrastructure, or global security is at risk.
- Auditing: Any invocation triggers cryptographically-signed justification and an emergency review within 24 hours.
- Remedy: automatic creation of remediation plan and compensation pool if abuse or collateral harm is proven.

---

## 5 — Intuition Node (how bravery uses it)
- Intuition = an emergency overlay that surfaces correlated multisensory signals for player decision-making.
- **Design**: minimal, translucent, opt-in per user; scales with "harmonic resonance" variable (game state / world state).
- **Mechanic**: Intuition flags -> BraveAction suggestions with prefilled intent and scope; player chooses to execute.
- **Fail-safe**: Intuition suggestions are never absolute authorizations; player consent or multi-signer required.

---

## 6 — Bee (Civic) Law tie-ins (example)
- Theft of vital ecological assets (e.g., "bee wallet" assets) triggers a three-strike rule: replace ×3, locked council hearing, escalating penalties.
- 3 Strikes = automatic temporary quorum review and community restitution pool activation.

---

## 7 — Implementation Notes (engineer-friendly)
- **Events**: Every Brave Action emits an `Event { actor_id, time, intent_hash, scope_hash, signature }`.
- **Ledger**: Use append-only ledger (blockchain or equivalent) with off-chain proofs for privacy.
- **Rollbacks**: Implement reversible transactions with snapshotting. Limit rollback windows and attach reason codes.
- **Council API**: `POST /council/propose`, `POST /council/approve`, `GET /council/review/:id`.
- **Thresholds/Config**: `R_brave`, `rollback_window_seconds`, `emergency_signers_count` — configurable by council.

---

## 8 — Governance & Review
- Brave Codex is living; changes require:
  - Draft → public comment period (14 days) → Council review → stamped update.
- Emergency errata: minor fixes allowed via expedited vote (majority + steward quorum).

---

## 9 — Ethics & Safeguards
- Human-centric priority: protect life and rights.
- No anonymous unilateral escalation—every emergency must be attributable.
- Privacy: store sensitive telemetry encrypted; zero-knowledge proofs used for public audits when needed.

---

## 10 — Cascading & Integration checklist
- [ ] Add `Brave` archetype to node registry.
- [ ] Implement BraveAction event types in event schema.
- [ ] Wire `No-Mercy` flow to emergency multisignature process.
- [ ] Add intuition overlay toggle (UX) and opt-in telemetry.
- [ ] Create council packet generator for post-action audits.
- [ ] Add test harness + red team scenarios (shadow realm exploitation).
- [ ] Localization & cultural review for phrasing (avoid harmful slurs—see replacement glossary).

---

## 11 — Replacement glossary (clean language)
Replace harmful or outdated terms across the code/docs with neutral alternatives (examples):
- `retard` → `oddly inspiring` (or better: `unexpected-behavior` / `edge-case-user`).
- `murk` → `defeat` / `neutralize`.
- Maintain a per-repo glossary and enforced linter.

---

## 12 — Appendix: Example BraveAction flow (sequence)
1. Player senses intuition overlay -> selects suggested BraveAction.
2. BraveAction `intent_hash` + scope posted to ledger (pre-announce).
3. System snapshots relevant game-state.
4. BraveAction executes within `rollback_window`.
5. Event & telemetry recorded; emergency auditors notified if threshold breached.
6. Council review packet auto-generated.
