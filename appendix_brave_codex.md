> Brave Codex — Appendix

Principle. Bravery is a survival mechanic and collective responsibility: the ability to act under uncertainty while protecting the vulnerable and repairing harm.

Core Tenets

1. Intention First. Courage must be guided by clear, stated intent. Before escalations, state purpose and risk.


2. Repair Over Revenge. When harm occurs, primary default: repair, accountability, restitution. Escalation only when repair fails.


3. Proportioned Risk. Actions taken in defense must be proportional to harm averted and minimize collateral damage.


4. Transparent Authority. Decisions bound to bravery claims are logged, auditable, and subject to community review.


5. Ritual of Return. Anyone who used force for defense must pass a restoration procedure: public accounting, therapeutic recomposition, and reintegration.



Practical Mechanisms

Bravery Ledger: signed, time-stamped logs for defensive acts; immutable (crypto-anchor) and accessible to council nodes.

50¢ Rule: (Gameplay mechanic) small frictions exist to discourage reckless Shadow flips; proceeds fund restorative actions and the public good.

Trial-by-Remedy: disputes default to structured repair ceremonies before punitive measures.


Ethics Note. Bravery is not permission to harm. The codex is binding on all nodes and masternodes; violations trigger automatic review and temporary sanctioning.
