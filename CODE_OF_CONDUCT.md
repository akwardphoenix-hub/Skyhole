# Code of Conduct — Skyhole

Skyhole is a CC0 public-domain project inviting builders, artists, researchers,
and players to co-create a fix-it-first civic MMO + harmonized OS. We want a
space that is radically welcoming, safe to experiment in, and serious about
consequences when harm happens.

## Our pledge
We commit to a harassment-free, inclusive collaboration experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or
expression, level of experience, education, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards
Examples of behavior that helps the project thrive:
- Being kind, direct, and honest; disagreeing without contempt.
- Offering constructive feedback with clear, runnable suggestions.
- Respecting privacy and consent in any data, images, or stories used.
- Choosing language that uplifts (no slurs, dog-whistles, or demeaning memes).
- Designing features with “fix-it-first” safety in mind.

Behaviors that are not OK:
- Harassment, doxxing, stalking, or sustained disruption (online or IRL).
- Hate speech, dehumanizing language, or targeted insults.
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwanted sexual attention.
- Non-consensual data capture, covert tracking, or unsafe “experiments.”
- Bypassing, disabling, or encouraging others to bypass safety layers.
- Filing issues/PRs intended to provoke, mislead, or derail (“griefing”).

## Scope
This code applies to all project spaces: GitHub issues/PRs, discussions, docs,
chats, events, and any project-branded spaces (virtual or physical).

## Reporting
- **Private:** Email the maintainers at **[replace-with-contact]**.
- **GitHub:** Open a confidential “Safety Report” issue (template provided),
  or use GitHub’s “Report abuse” tools.
- **Urgent harm:** Prioritize personal safety and contact local authorities.

We will acknowledge reports within 72 hours, keep reporters informed, and
respect requests for anonymity wherever possible.

## Enforcement
Maintainers will act in the best interest of the community. Consequences may
include, escalating as needed:

1. **Note:** Private clarification and request to change behavior.
2. **Warning:** Written warning; temporary participation limits may apply.
3. **Timeout:** Temporary ban from project spaces or contribution activity.
4. **Removal:** Permanent ban and, where applicable, revocation of access.

Appeals can be sent to the same reporting address with “Appeal” in the subject.

## Attribution
Inspired by the Contributor Covenant and multiple open governance codes, adapted
for Skyhole’s fix-it-first ethos and safety layers.
