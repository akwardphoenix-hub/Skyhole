# Vimana — Handoff Packet

## 0. Purpose
This document bundles project vision, architecture notes, legal status (CC0), governance rules, immediate TODOs, and references for expert handoff.

## 1. Project snapshot
- Status: Concept & design, many nodes drafted in conversation, art assets present.
- License: CC0 public domain (see LICENSE).
- Primary goals: civic gamification + cybersecurity layers + biological asset protection + cross-cultural inclusion + global masternode governance.

## 2. Key concepts & short definitions
- Legendary: flagship mascot/masternode. Voice for "fix it first" and veteran authority in-game.
- Polymath: structural integration node. Responsible for merging science, art, law, and engineering.
- Bee Law: protection rules for biological network assets (three-strike repair/replace policy).
- Intuition Node: opt-in overlay using multi-sensory and peripheral inputs to pause/alert players.
- Void / Wuji / Kong: meta-elements for balance (design decisions described in Appendix A).
- Uppercut City & Orthrus Trials: gameplay event sequences (see Gameplay.md for loops).
- No-Mercy Clause: emergency activation for jurisprudence and policing nodes (codified).

## 3. Governance & Council
- Council: multisector body (technical, religious-cultural, legal, TCM experts).
- Voting: on-chain, transparent, verifiable; thresholds defined per node category (TBD by devs).
- Emergency protocols: "No Mercy" and "Ghost Containment" clauses (see Appendix).

## 4. Security alert summary
- Threat vectors: deepfakes of streams, spoofing camera inputs, 0-day shadow-lab exploits.
- Suggested mitigations: multi-factor peripheral verification (camera + GPS + signed ID), red-team simulation, council escrow for critical switches.

## 5. Technical architecture (high-level)
- Client: cross-platform; minimal mobile + VR support.
- Backend: multi-region, sharded masternode network; each user can run a light client.
- On-chain components: token for civic incentive; multisig governance contracts.
- Peripherals & opt-ins: home camera pause-feature, mag-sol / gyroscopic hardware (specs TBD).
- Data privacy: opt-in by default; all critical biometric/peripheral data processed locally unless user consents otherwise.

## 6. Immediate next steps (short list)
- Clean legal release (LICENSE — CC0) — DONE.
- Create repository structure: /docs /spec /assets /legal /experiments.
- Export full conversation to `conversation_plaintext.txt` and upload to /docs/ (for provenance).
- Create `Project-Overview.pf` (one-pager) and `Handoff-Packet.zip` containing docs/art.
- Red-team test for camera spoofing & deepfake mitigation.
- Bee Law audit with ecological experts and legal counsel.
- Recruit TCM & religion council members for node-level input.

## 7. Files & locations (suggested)
- README.md (executive summary)
- LICENSE (CC0)
- handoff.md (this file)
- conversation_plaintext.txt (full chat dump)
- spec/ (technical specs, API)
- assets/ (images, mockups)
- governance/ (voting rules, council charters)
- legal/ (privacy, data-processing agreements, jurisdiction notes)

## 8. Contacts & stakeholders
- [Add contacts here: core devs, legal counsel, ecological advisors, religious council liaisons]

## 9. Appendix (glossary, important clauses)
- Appendix A: Intuition vs. Jumping-to-conclusion policy
- Appendix B: Three-Bee rule (replacement formulas)
- Appendix C: No Mercy / Ghost clause (emergency whistleblower & takedown)
- Appendix D: Orthrus & Odyssey event designs (gameplay)
- Appendix E: List of flagged privacy concerns & recommended mitigations

## 10. How to use this handoff
1. Create a new GitHub repo or update existing repo root with README.md and LICENSE.
2. Add this handoff.md to root.
3. Upload conversation_plaintext.txt (full chat log) into /docs/.
4. Announce CC0 and the repo in one place you control (tweet, Mastodon, mirror — whatever you use).
