This project began as a single, continuous design window — a raw conversation where visions of games, governance, and harmony mixed with lived experience. Over time those sparks were structured into nodes, codices, and governance primitives. TRANSFORMATION.md records that evolution: the decisions, the reasons, and the original voice — so future builders know both the source and the intent.
