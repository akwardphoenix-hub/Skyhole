# Logic Protocol Cascade (Canonical)
**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** [You / Keeper] — released CC0  
**Purpose:** Create a single, auditable, machine-applicable cascade of rules, replacements, and game-model invariants. This document is the source of truth for automated transforms and human council review.

---

## 1. Global Text Replacements (safety + clarity)
- Replace token: `retard` -> `oddly inspiring`
- Normalize: `Orthrus` (spell variant fixed to `Orthrus`)
- Do not remove memes — only sanitize language where it harms/insults.

## 2. Fix-It-First Doctrine (highest priority)
- Any node/transaction flagged by integrity checks MUST be put through "Fix-It-First" pipeline.
- Pipeline: Validate → Quarantine (soft) → Auto-repair (if safe) → Council Review (if not).
- No permanent state-change allowed until Fix-It-First completes or council issues override.

## 3. No Mercy Clause (triggering & flow)
- Trigger: Verified evidence of malicious tamper or active attack against masternode(s).
- Immediate actions: 
  1. Snapshot ledger (immutable dump)
  2. Lock affected nodes (read-only)
  3. Notify Council + Pattern Keepers + Red Team
  4. Legendary (AI persona) produces a public / archived report of remediation plan (auto-generated)
- Penalty/Remediation: tiered sanctions (repair, restitutive token burn, council trial).

## 4. Bee Law (three-strike rule; theft of critical bio/infrastructure)
- Theft = unauthorized removal or tampering with bee-wallets or bee-infrastructure.
- 1st offense: automated restitution request (replace 3× resources) + warning.
- 2nd offense: heavier restitution + temporary node-blacklist.
- 3rd offense: permanent ban from bee-related governance; criminal referral to council authority.
- Fringe-case: verified accidental damage → remediation via insurance pool; council review.

## 5. Intuition Node (game + safety)
- Intuition = emergency overlay. Implementation:
  - Intuition ON (opt-in): subtle predictive assistance; low signal at initial launch; scales with harmony index.
  - Intuition OFF: baseline deterministic behavior; no overlays.
- Guiding principle: Intuition must be *transparent* (show source data on request) and *toggleable*.
- Intuition is **not** cryptographic noise; treat it as processed multimodal signals flagged as "intuition".

## 6. Shadow Protocol (white-hat pivot)
- Shadow players may choose “reformation” path. Mechanic:
  - If shadow node demonstrates consistent white-hat behavior over N events → council-eligibility review.
  - Council grants access to remediation tasks and “guardian” status.

## 7. Excalibur / Vimana / Harmonics Node (high-level)
- Excalibur: artifact that requires harmony threshold; collects intention & resonance.
- Vimana: public infrastructure node that maps local harmonics (Sun, Moon, Pyramids, North Star) to system-time.
- Safety: artifacts should be locked behind council multisig and require 2FA + biometric confirmation for activation.

## 8. Councils and Approvals
- Anything affecting species-level assets (bees, endemic ecosystems) is council-level (human + expert nodes).
- Provide human-in-the-loop reviews for cultural-sensitivity features and religion-adjacent mechanics.

## 9. Appendices (auto-attach)
- Appendix A: Bee law legal flow + sample templates.
- Appendix B: No Mercy Clause technical manifest (snapshot steps + forensic flow).
- Appendix C: Intuition Node technical spec (API schemas + signal sources).
- Appendix D: Orthrus trials gameplay loop and reward/penalty economics.
- Appendix E: Memetics & cultural mapping (how to safely adapt memes across locales).

## 10. Operational Notes
- All changes should be tracked via git with a single PR that references this Cascade doc.
- Any automated find/replace scripts must run in a dry-run mode first and produce a patch for human review.
