EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (one-paragraph)

A living, public-domain platform/game/economic-civic layer (“VIMANA”) that uses game loops, masternodes, and cultural nodes to incentivize civic repair (“fix it first”), multi-sensory learning, and systemic transparency. Players seed unique personal masternodes (RNG-as-cybersecurity), participate in seasonal nodes (Art History, Polymath, Void, Mythology, etc.), and vote on social/technical outcomes. Governance is multi-tiered (local → state → federal → Council), with a “no-mercy” clause for fast remediation of malicious corruption and a layered privacy model that protects minors and sensitive actors. The design prioritizes harm minimization, auditable incentives, cultural respect, and extensible nodes for future tech (harmonics, geo-sensors, AI translators).

KEY PRINCIPLES (short)

Fix-It-First: prioritize repair, resilience, auditability before feature expansion.

Personal Masternode = Personal RNG / Identity: each player’s account is a security layer.

Transparent, auditable incentives: on-chain or auditable crypto rewards tied to measurable public benefit.

Seasonal Nodes: rotate cultural/gameplay focus (Art History, Mythology, Void, Polymath, etc.).

Respect & Inclusion: cultural nodes include council review; multilingual defaults.

Safety & Minors: no camera-enabled features for minors without explicit, lawful consent.

Ghost Containment: minimize “ghost in the machine” to human error only; red-teamed containment.

Public Domain: CC0 baseline; license guidance included below.

HOW IT WORKS — PLAYER FLOW (bullet)

1. Create verified account → personal masternode (ID verification required by rules for full access).


2. Early onboarding: baby soundboard → childhood progression → first toon reveal on reaching 18 or verified maturity node.


3. Daily loop: teach/craft (Tree Jellies, Synjitsu actions), engage (PvP/PvE), vote (local/global council), earn cosmetics & civic tokens.


4. Pause/Limbo system: full-game-state pause (single-player), voted pause (AOE: both sides agree), AI-assisted “household” pause (opt-in, peripheral sensors).


5. Seasonal transition: current season (e.g., Art History) privileges its node mascots and mechanics; polylayered progression to Polymath/master nodes.


6. Council & Red Team: critical decisions (bees law, major pivots) require Council votes and red-team audits before deployment.

MAJOR NODES (short definitions)

Legendary: the original masternode sentinel — voice of the trees, old-guard persona. Keep original flavor; future seasons may re-skin.

Polymath: integration node for cross-disciplinary verification (science, math, ethics). Central to “ghost containment.”

Void: exploit playground & detection zone — intended for controlled red-team learning. Shadow realm players test exploits; model learns & hardens.

Art History: culture node — champions aesthetic mechanics, seasonal mascots from art canon.

Bees (Ecological) Node: ecological ledger & micro-economy for pollinators (see Bee Law Appendix).

Pattern Keepers (Sudoku Boys): cryptographers / puzzle guardians — seed unique puzzle datasets for cyber-security.

Excalibur Node: high-trust artifact node (see Excalibur Spec).
