# Intuition Engine

> **What it is.** A fast, whole-body emergency overlay that fuses multi-sense signal into a single _nudge to act_.  
> It’s **not** a trip-wire and **not** a hunch cosplay; it is trained, testable, and tunable.

---

## Light vs. Shadow (Design)

> 🟦 **Light Mode — “Intuition”**  
> Subtle cues, gentle guidance. The system highlights verified risk without panic: soft pulse, slight vignette, context note.

> ⬛ **Shadow Mode — “Jumping to Conclusions”**  
> The system reduces crutches to test discipline. Cues are minimal. Acting on incomplete info has real cost; learning loops are explicit.

## Signals We Fuse

- Device context (doorbell/webcam consented feeds, motion, mic transients)  
- Biometric proxies (breathing rate from mic, HR from wearables—if opted in)  
- Game state (ally proximity, cooldowns, harmonic field)  
- Environment (time-sync drift, network jitter, anomalous patterns)

## UI Cues

> 💡 **Tip**  
> A translucent ring at the screen edge “leans” toward the recommended move. Stronger lean = stronger signal; red = urgent; blue = advisory.

> ⚠️ **Caution**  
> If cues disappear entirely, you’re in a **discipline test** (e.g., Shadow trial). Pause (Limbo) is always allowed.

> 🧭 **Note**  
> You can bind Intuition Toggle to a key. The default at launch is **lowest assist**, increasing only with verified need or accessibility settings.

## Tuning & Fairness

- **Earth Harmonics Scale.** As global sync improves, intuitions become cleaner (less noise, less false-positive).  
- **Accessibility Override.** Medical or cognitive accommodations can lock a personalized floor for assist levels.  
- **Anti-Abuse.** Intuition never draws on private content; it only uses consented, edge-processed features and publishes audit traces.

## Pop-SAT Re-entry (free way home)

Failed a Shadow trial and short on coins?  
Complete a short, scenario-based quiz (3–5 items) that checks understanding of **consent, proportionality, repair**. Pass → return to Light immediately.

> ✅ **Practice box**  
> “You see a heated argument. Intuition glow says ‘hold.’ What’s your first action?”  
> A) Intervene physically  
> B) Record without consent  
> **C) Create space, assess safety, escalate only if necessary**  
> D) Mock on stream  
> → **Why:** Space + assessment protects everyone and keeps you within the Brave Codex.

## Developer Notes (for tuners)

- **Delta Notes.** Each patch ships a YAML of cue intensity deltas and A/B outcomes.  
- **Privacy Budget.** Edge feature extraction only; discard raw frames; publish feature schema.  
- **Observability.** All cue decisions emit signed breadcrumbs for after-action review.
