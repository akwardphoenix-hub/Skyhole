# Unified Brave Codex

**Purpose.** Bravery in this system means _choosing truth-aligned, repair-oriented action under uncertainty_ while protecting the vulnerable, the commons, and future players. This codex operationalizes that across Light & Shadow modes.

---

## First Principles

1. **Truth before ego.** Prefer verifiable signal over vibe when the two conflict; log your basis.  
2. **Repair over revenge.** When harm occurs, _first_ stop harm, _then_ repair, _then_ improve the system.  
3. **Consent & dignity.** No forced reveals. No dehumanization. Humor is welcome; humiliation is not.  
4. **Transparency with safety.** Maximum clarity with minimum risk: redact specifics, not intentions.  
5. **Steward, not owner.** People, cultures, ecosystems (e.g., **Bee Law**) are co-stakeholders, not assets.  
6. **Proportionality.** Force (social, technical, or literal) scales to the smallest effective level.  
7. **Pause is power.** The **Limbo**/Demi-Loki pause exists to protect real lives; it is never “cowardice.”  
8. **Checks & counters.** Every tool has an audited counter-tool (see **Shadow Protocol**).  
9. **Children first.** No camera on minors’ devices; strict adult-only identity gates; parental surfaces are transparent.  
10. **Sacred satire.** **University of Meme Logic** is a civic layer: aim jokes _up_ the power gradient.

## Operational Rules (light + shadow)

- **Harmonic Readiness.** Before major events, run **Harmonic Mesh** checklist (signal, sync, fallback, logs).  
- **Escalation ladder.** Conversation → Mediation → Council Review → Temporary Quarantine → Last-resort Sanctions.  
- **Three-Strikes Doctrine (Bee Law).** Theft/exploitation of protected species or cultural primitives triggers:  
  - Strike 1: Full replacement ×3 and education module.  
  - Strike 2: Replacement ×9 + service quota + observability probation.  
  - Strike 3: Network ejection + restorative pathway defined by Council & affected parties.
- **No-Mercy Clause (safety).** When credible imminent harm is detected, system may freeze, fence, and notify while preserving due-process trails.  
- **Mirror Tactic (Excalibur).** When confronted by deception, surface verified state back to the actor (“hold up the mirror”), then offer repair.  
- **Orthurus Trials.** Light path emphasizes insight & repair; Shadow path emphasizes consequences & cost. Both loop back to learning.

## Metrics (how we score bravery)

- **Cost Paid:** personal stake or effort offered to reduce harm.  
- **Risk Shared:** burden distributed off the vulnerable.  
- **Repair Rate:** time to contain + completeness of restitution.  
- **Transparency Delta:** increase in verified clarity vs. prior state.  
- **Consent Rate:** proportion of actions with informed consent.  
- **Outcome Quality:** did the world get safer/fairer/freer?

Scores are _diagnostic_, not clout. They tune matchmaking and privileges, not status.

---

## Cultural Stewardship & Inclusion

- **Multi-faith guardrails.** Respect observances (e.g., prayer windows, sabbath modes); no forced participation.  
- **Indigenous sovereignty.** Cultural nodes (e.g., bead-worlds) require custodian sign-off and benefit-sharing.  
- **Language equity.** Core docs ship in major languages; PRs welcome from native speakers; machine-assist is clearly labeled.

---

## Enforcement & Appeals

- **Pattern Keepers** verify cryptographic claims, provenance, and chain-of-custody.  
- **Council** makes proportionality calls; no single seat can sanction alone.  
- **Appeals** must include: what happened, evidence, proposed repair, and what you learned.
