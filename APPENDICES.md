Appendix A — Brave Codex (permanent appendix)

Purpose: codify bravery as civic virtue — bravery = intention + accountable action + transparency.

1. Bravery is an opt-in flag tied to reputation.


2. Leaders with Brave flag must pass transparency checks and undergo periodic review.


3. Bravery grants access to certain trials (e.g., Odyssey events) but also stricter audit trails.


4. Cultural respect clause: Brave Codex respects indigenous honor paradigms — cross-review with tribal councils before rollout.


5. Amendment protocol: any Brave Codex change must pass Council + community referendum.

Appendix B — Excalibur Spec (artifact node)

Role: situational ultimate that becomes available when planetary harmonics exceed a threshold. Used to enforce “fix it first” emergency protocols.

Unlock condition: Harmony Index ≥ H_unlock (computed from multisensory aggregate: North Star Time sync, Sun/Moon/pyramid shadow clocks, geomagnetic harmonics).

Function: non-destructive enforcement: temporarily elevates corrective authority to roll back bad state changes, sequester corrupted nodes, and enact emergency patches.

Mechanics: AI-augmented vibroblade metaphor — feeds on intention + resonance; wielded by council-authorized agents.

Safeguards: double opt-in, multi-signature, immutable audit trail; permanent cosmetic marker on user who wields.

Gameplay: trial events where players may attempt to earn transitory wield rights by passing harmonics tests / Odyssey trials.

Appendix C — Bee Law (permanent, draft)

Goal: protect pollinator economy & cultural assets.

Three-strike rule: theft or manipulation of bee assets triggers:

Strike 1: instant watch flag + restitution requirement (replace 3x bees).

Strike 2: escalated restitution + temporary service restrictions.

Strike 3: permanent loss of trusted privileges + restorative service (repair & fund bee restoration).


Fault margin clause: accidental damage (proof required) triggers remediation path; Council review for fringe cases.

Council review heavy: bee law changes are council-locked; human oversight mandatory.

Appendix D — Orthrus (corrected)

Spelling fixed: “Orthrus” (not Orthrus/orthus misspellings).

Character sheet highlights: two heads — Alpha (stoic, measured), Puppy (playful, affectionate). Their dialog is twin-like: respectful sparring, sibling bickering, not clipped bipolar noise.

Trial mechanics: Light Realm (tutorial) vs Shadow Realm (hard mode). Fail/redo flow: free redo in light realm; shadow resets incur a tax (or SAT pop-quiz alternative) to return.



---

Appendix E — Intuition / “Gift of Fear” Node

Definition: emergency overlay; rapid multi-sensory fusion that surfaces as a translucent ping. Not a tripwire.

Mechanics: subtle toggle at launch (low sensitivity) → scales with Earth harmonics (max when vimana full harmony).

Behavior: intuition biases reaction time, not deterministic outcomes. Wrong intuition = jump-to-conclusion (log & remediation).

Policy: Intuition is non-binding. Players may choose to follow or ignore. All uses are logged for audit & model tuning.



---

Appendix F — Pause / Limbo / Demi-Loki Mode

Single-player pause: full game-state snapshot saved; players can resume later.

Agreed Pause: both parties vote to pause; auto-resume on agreement or timeout.

Household pause (opt-in): integrates peripherals (Doorbell, baby sensors) to suggest pause; strict privacy opt-in.

Demi-Loki Mode: cosmetic toggle enabling “void cosplay” while flagged as non-privileged (no ledger changes).



---

Appendix G — Minors & Baby Board Rules

No camera features for minors by default.

Baby soundboard progression: tactile → audio → visuals unlocked as child ages with verified guardianship.

Parents informed of game impacts; opt-in for additional privacy features.



---

Appendix H — Ghost Containment + Ghost Clause

Ghost containment: red team AI sandbox with hardened rollbacks; ghost = <0.0000001 error allowed; human error only permitted for documented ops.

Ghost Clause: if ghost behavior occurs, immediate rollback, public incident report, and require compensatory Council action.

Appendix I — Language / Accessibility

Offensive term replacement: “retard” → “oddly inspiring” everywhere in exported docs. (Apply to code/text assets during repo push.)

Multilingual: produce canonical translations for top languages (Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, French, Russian, Portuguese). Start with English baseline; community-sourced council review for final phrasing.
